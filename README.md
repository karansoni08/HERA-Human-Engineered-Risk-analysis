# üß† HERA: Human Engineered Risk analysis
### Quantifying Human Cyber Risk through Behavioral Analytics + LLM-Driven Insight  

---

## üîç Overview  
Modern cybersecurity threats are increasingly **human-driven** such as phishing, impersonation, data mishandling, and insider misuse remain key attack vectors.  
This project introduces an **LLM-powered, human-centric threat-modeling framework** that analyzes behavioral data, quantifies risk, and generates actionable insights through LLM reasoning.

By combining deterministic analytics (for transparent scoring and detection) with **large-language-model intelligence** (for policy understanding, scenario generation, and mitigation guidance), this system transforms human behavior into measurable cybersecurity posture ‚Äî without using any real personal data.
