# üß† HERA: Human Engineered Risk Analysis  
## Software Development Plan (Corporate Edition)

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose  
This Software Development Plan (SDP) defines the scope, objectives, processes, resources, quality assurance, and risk management strategies for the development of **HERA (Human Engineered Risk Analysis)** an advanced, LLM based human centric threat modeling system that quantifies social engineering and insider risks using the **OMEO Framework (Origin, Method, Exposure, Outcome)**.

#### 1.2 Scope  
HERA automates the identification and analysis of human-driven security threats by integrating:
- Deterministic behavioral analytics and risk scoring  
- LLM driven policy reasoning, narrative generation, and mitigation guidance  
- A structured framework for Origin, Method, Exposure, and Outcome mapping  
- Executive-level reporting and visualization capabilities  

The system will be developed as an **enterprise grade research prototype** suitable for internal security teams, consultancy use, or integration within SOC environments.

### 3. Project Overview

#### 3.1 Objectives
- Quantify and model human-centric threats within organizational contexts.  
- Automate policy extraction, threat scenario simulation, and mitigation generation via LLMs.  
- Deliver transparent, explainable analytics aligned with enterprise security frameworks.  
- Ensure privacy, fairness, and reproducibility using synthetic data.

#### 3.2 Deliverables
- **Core Engine:** HTI computation and OMEO mapping.  
- **LLM Modules:** Policy extraction, scenario generator, analyst summarizer, mitigation coach.  
- **Visualization Suite:** Heatmaps, risk dashboards, executive reporting.  
- **Documentation:** Technical design, architecture, and user manuals.  
- **Compliance Package:** Ethics and privacy assurance report.

#### 3.3 Constraints
- No use of real or sensitive enterprise data (synthetic data only).  
- All LLM operations to run offline or within a controlled environment.  
- Compliance with data-handling and AI ethics guidelines.
