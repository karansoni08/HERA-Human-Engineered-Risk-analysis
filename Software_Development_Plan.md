# 🧠 HERA: Human Engineered Risk Analysis  
## Software Development Plan (Corporate Edition)

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose  
This Software Development Plan (SDP) defines the scope, objectives, processes, resources, quality assurance, and risk management strategies for the development of **HERA (Human Engineered Risk Analysis)** — a next-generation, LLM-assisted human-centric threat modeling system that quantifies social engineering and insider risks using the **OME² Framework (Origin • Method • Exposure • Outcome)**.

#### 1.2 Scope  
HERA automates the identification and analysis of human-driven security threats by integrating:
- Deterministic behavioral analytics and risk scoring  
- LLM-driven policy reasoning, narrative generation, and mitigation guidance  
- A structured framework for Origin, Method, Exposure, and Outcome mapping  
- Executive-level reporting and visualization capabilities  

The system will be developed as an **enterprise-grade research prototype** suitable for internal security teams, consultancy use, or integration within SOC environments.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

|------|-------------|
| HTI | Human Threat Index |
| OME² | Origin • Method • Exposure • Outcome Framework |
| LLM | Large Language Model |
| SOC | Security Operations Center |
| QA | Quality Assurance |

### 3. Project Overview

#### 3.1 Objectives
- Quantify and model human-centric threats within organizational contexts.  
- Automate policy extraction, threat scenario simulation, and mitigation generation via LLMs.

- Ensure privacy, fairness, and reproducibility using synthetic data.

#### 3.2 Deliverables
- **Core Engine:** HTI computation and OME² mapping.  
- **LLM Modules:** Policy extraction, scenario generator, analyst summarizer, mitigation coach.

### 6. Technical Process

#### 6.1 Development Approach
Agile-inspired iterative cycle (2-week sprints):
- **Sprint 1–2:** Data & architecture validation  
- **Sprint 3–4:** Analytics engine implementation  
- **Sprint 5–6:** LLM module integration and refinement  
- **Sprint 7–8:** Testing, documentation, and deployment  

Version control through GitLab/GitHub with structured branching (`main`, `dev`, `feature/*`).

#### 6.2 Methods, Tools, and Techniques
- **Languages:** Python 3.11+  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Faker, Matplotlib, Plotly, Jinja2, Pydantic, ReportLab  
- **LLM Integration:** Ollama (LLaMA 3 / Mistral) for local inference  
- **Testing:** PyTest, JSON Schema validation  
- **Documentation:** Markdown, Mermaid, ReportLab PDF  

#### 6.3 OME² Framework Implementation
1. **Origin** – Identify the entity initiating a potential threat.  
2. **Method** – Define the behavioral or technical vector used.  
3. **Exposure** – Map vulnerable data assets or workflows.  
4. **Outcome** – Quantify business or operational impact.  

Each event in the dataset is classified according to these four pillars to maintain interpretability and cross-framework compatibility.
